# Task-7
Array Methods [map,reduce,filter] README
=====================================

Overview
--------
This repository includes four JavaScript scripts that use the XMLHttpRequest object to fetch data from the "[https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)" API. Each script focuses on different aspects of the retrieved data.


File Structure
--------------
* `index.html` - The main HTML file 
*   `script.js`: Filters countries with "Asia" as their continent and extracts their names.
*   `script1.js`: Filters countries with a population less than 2 lakhs.
*   `script2.js`: Extracts the name, flag, and capital of each country.
*   `script3.js`: Filters countries that use USD as a currency.
*   `script4.js`: Calculates the total population of all countries.
